Credit Card Fraud Detection
Detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data using machine learning.

Overview
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Out of 284,807 transactions, only 492 are fraudulentâ€”highlighting a major class imbalance (0.172%).

Objectives
The primary objective is to build a robust classification model capable of accurately detecting fraudulent transactions. Key tasks include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand dataset patterns and structure.

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Feature Engineering: Create and transform features to enhance model performance.

Model Training & Evaluation: Train various models, handle class imbalance, and evaluate on test data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model performance on unseen data.

Dataset
Source: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Size: 284,807 transactions over 2 days

Fraudulent transactions: 492 (~0.172%)

Challenge: Significant class imbalance makes model evaluation and training complex.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.10.14

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Amra-Shaikh/FindDefault.git

Usage
Load the dataset.

Perform EDA to understand data distribution and identify insights.

Preprocess the data:

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates

Detect and treat outliers

Balance the dataset using techniques like SMOTE or undersampling.

Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluate the model on test data using metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC.

Future Work
Advanced Models: Integrate ensemble models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) or deep learning (e.g., LSTM, autoencoders).

External Data: Enhance model inputs with user behavior or geographic data for richer context.

Automated Tuning: Experiment with advanced tuning frameworks like Optuna or Hyperopt.

Model Deployment: Package the model with a REST API for real-time predictions.
